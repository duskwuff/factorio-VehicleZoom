Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2021-11-22
  Changes:
    - Removed the cinematic zoom upon entering/leaving vehicles. This looked cool, but broke other mods which used vehicle events (notably, Space Exploration and Vehicle Snap).
    - Scales are now relative to the global display scale, so they don't need to be adjusted for high-DPI displays (e.g. on macOS).
